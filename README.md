# Quality-Evaluation-of-Skull-Stripped-Brain-MRI-images

Develop a Data Mining algorithm or tool to check the quality of the skull-stripped MRI images. This algorithm or tool must meet the following two basic requirements: 
- Determine whether the facial features are removed to the extent that people cannot identify the person based on the remaining facial features in the skull-stripped MRI image. 
- Determine whether any brain voxels are unintentionally removed, resulting in the loss of important brain information.
